Use Google APIs to implement the app. Go though the API documentation linked below and decide the best approach for each of the modules that you need to build.
* https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/guides

* Please do not use IMAP based extensions like mail-notifier to build this. Use Google’s APIs instead.



Build this app on Node.js. Any other submissions will not be evaluated
Use modern JavaScript standards while coding.
* For Example: Try to use ‘let’ and ‘const’ and avoid ‘var’

Use Promises, async/await wherever possible to avoid callback hell and unreadable code
Write clean code, add comments wherever needed. Remember, your reporting manager would be reading and evaluating your code
Write a detailed spec about the libraries and technologies used
Lastly, write a note on areas where your code can be improved
